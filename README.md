# 11_webserv

## Project overview

The objective of this project is to create your own HTTP server. It should be inspired by Nginx and run on a web browser.

## How to use this repository?

### Recommended Operating System (OS)

I recommand to use a Linux distribution such as:

- Latest stable version (LTS) of Ubuntu
- Latest stable version (LTS) of Debian

### Steps to follow

1. Go to the directory where you want to clone the directory: `cd path/of/repository/`
2. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:romainkassel/11_webserv.git`
3. Enter into cloned repository: `cd 11_webserv`
4. Launch the project's build: `make`
5. Start the server: `./webserv`
6. Here you go! If everything went smoothly, the server should be listening and waiting for requests!

## Cool! How can I query the server now?

By default, the server is listening on `localhost` address (`127.0.0.1`) and binded on the port `8080`

You can query the server in two different ways.

### Using CURL

You can use your terminal by:
1. Opening a new shell/window instance (the server should be running and listening on the other one)
2. Running the `curl` command in the new shell: `curl localhost:8080`.

The server will receive the request and return the following response:

It relates to the HTML document located at `www/index.html`.

### Using your browser

If you are a more visual person, you can:
1. Open your favorite browser (Firefox recommended)
2. Enter the following URL in the address bar: `http://localhost:8080`

> [!NOTE]
> Each time you will query the server, it will log client connections on the console standard output:

## Can I customise my server?

Like Nginx, yes you can!

By default, with no argument, the server use the following configuration file: `conf/default.conf`.

You can create your own or select one of the configuration files that we have created for you and for our tests in one of the subfolders located within `conf/tests`.

As Nginx does, you can:

- select a custom port for listening within the authorised range, in which case an error will be thrown
- create multiple server directives: `server {}`
- within each server directive, you can create multiple location directives with different modifiers (`/` or `=` for example)
- play with locations by creating folders and HTML files and see if the server will serve the content or throw a 404 error

> [!TIP]
> If you want explanations and inspiration for test cases, you can check this article from DigitalOcean: [Nginx location directive examples](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nginx-location-directive)
> You can also use our own location folders and files located within the `default/` folder

## Which System Call has been used for the IO Multiplexing part?

When building a server, you have to use IO Multiplexing by polling file descriptors (FD) that are ready for:
- reading (incoming client connections on a socket)
- or writing (sending back a response to the client through a socket)

For polling, you have 3 different system call options: `select`, `poll` or `epoll`.

For this project, I selected Epoll as it is the most efficient and modern option.
Here is a significant example of *the time it takes to check different quantities of file descriptors via some of the most common polling methods*.

If you want more information, this picture comes from the following article: [epoll() Tutorial â€“ epoll() In 3 Easy Steps!](https://suchprogramming.com/epoll-in-3-easy-steps/)

Epoll is included within the following hear file: `<sys/epoll.h>`.

Basically, epoll is broken down into three sub system calls:

### epoll_create() 

It creates a new epoll instance and returns a file descriptor.
Only one epoll instance is used throughout the server's lifetime.
This epoll instance will contain all socket FD related to server (ports) and client connections.

### epoll_ctl()

Epoll_ctl allows to manage file descriptors within your epoll instance created via epoll_create():
- if you select the second argument `EPOLL_CTL_ADD`, it add FDs you want to poll within your instance
- if you select `EPOLL_CTL_DEL`, it will remove the FD of your choice from the epoll instance

### epoll_wait()

This system call query the epoll instance in order to know if one or more file descriptors are ready for reading (EPOLLIN) and/or reading (EPOLLOUT)

> [!TIP]
> To get more information about epoll() and its different system call prototypes, you can simply run `man epoll` in your terminal.

I also I recommend you to check this amazing article from the "Code(quoi);" blog: [Sockets and Network Programming in C ](https://www.codequoi.com/en/sockets-and-network-programming-in-c/)
It is not directly related to epoll(), but it explains really well how sockets works with examples using select() and poll().

## I tested the site and I'm happy. Now I'd like to clean it up. What do I do?

1. In your terminal, stop the server by clicking on `CTRL + C`
2. Go outside of the repository: `cd ..`
3. Remove the repository: `rm -rf 11_webserv`
