# 11_webserv

## Project overview

The objective of this project is to create your own HTTP server.<br >
It should be inspired by Nginx and run on a web browser.

## How to use this repository?

### Recommended Operating System (OS)

I recommand to use a Linux distribution such as:

- Latest stable version (LTS) of Ubuntu
- Latest stable version (LTS) of Debian

### Steps to follow

1. Go to the directory where you want to clone the directory: `cd path/of/repository/`
2. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:romainkassel/11_webserv.git`
3. Enter into cloned repository: `cd 11_webserv`
4. Launch the project's build: `make`
5. Start the server: `./webserv`
6. Here you go! If everything went smoothly, the server should be listening and waiting for requests!

## Cool! How can I query the server now?

By default, the server is listening on the `localhost` address (`127.0.0.1`) and binded on the port `8080`

Knowing this, you can query the server in two different ways.

### Using CURL

You can use your terminal by:
1. Opening a new shell/window instance (the server should be running and listening on the other one)
2. Running the `curl` command in the new shell: `curl localhost:8080`

The server will:
- receive the request and log the client connection on the standard output (left side of the picture below)
- return a response including a HTML document located at `www/index.html` (right side of the picture below)

### Using your browser

If you prefer a user interface (UI), you can:
1. Open your favorite browser (Firefox recommended)
2. Enter the following URL in the address bar: `http://localhost:8080`

It will return the following index page:

## Can I customise my server?

Like Nginx, yes you can!

By default, with no argument, the server use the following configuration file: `conf/default.conf`

You can create your own file or select one of the configurations that we have created for you and for our tests.<br />
They are available within one of the subfolders located at `conf/tests`

Then, you can simply pass it as an argument of the program.<br />
If we had to manually add the default conf file, it would be `./webserv default.conf` (here, you don't need the `conf/` prefix)

As Nginx does, you can:

- select a custom port for binding within the authorised range (if not, an error will be thrown)
- create multiple server directives: `server {}`
- within each server directive, you can create multiple location directives with different modifiers (`/` or `=` for example)
- play with locations by creating folders, HTML files and see if the server will serve the content or throw a 404 error

> [!TIP]
> If you want explanations and inspiration for test cases, you can check this article from DigitalOcean: [Nginx location directive examples](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nginx-location-directive)
> You can also use our own location folders and files located within the `default/` folder

## Which System Call has been used for the IO Multiplexing part?

When building a server, you have to use IO Multiplexing by polling file descriptors (FD) that are ready for:
- reading (incoming client connection on a socket)
- writing (sending back a response to the client through a socket)

For polling, you have 3 different system call options: `select()`, `poll()` or `epoll()`

For this project, I selected `epoll()` as it is the most efficient option.

Here is a significant example of "*the time it takes to check different quantities of file descriptors via some of the most common polling methods*".

<img width="681" height="129" alt="webserv-multiplexing-poll-times-performance" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84b34018-06cc-4439-b4e2-5f91a35d4180" />

If you want more information, this picture comes from the following article: [epoll() Tutorial â€“ epoll() In 3 Easy Steps!](https://suchprogramming.com/epoll-in-3-easy-steps/)

`Epoll()` is included within the following header file: `<sys/epoll.h>`

Basically, `epoll()` is broken down into three sub system calls, as described below.

### epoll_create() 

It creates a new epoll instance and returns a FD.<br />
Only one epoll instance is used throughout the server's lifetime.<br />
This epoll instance will contain all socket FDs related to the server (ports) and client connections.

### epoll_ctl()

`Epoll_ctl()` allows to manage file descriptors within your epoll instance created via `epoll_create()`

You have different second argument options such as:
- `EPOLL_CTL_ADD` -> attaches a FD you want to poll to your epoll instance
- `EPOLL_CTL_DEL` -> removes the FD of your choice from the epoll instance

### epoll_wait()

This system call queries the epoll instance in order to know if one or more file descriptors are ready for:
- reading (EPOLLIN)
- and/or writing (EPOLLOUT)


> [!TIP]
> To get more information about `epoll()` and its different system calls (such as prototypes), you can simply run `man epoll` in your terminal.

I also recommend you to check this amazing article from the "Code(quoi);" blog: [Sockets and Network Programming in C ](https://www.codequoi.com/en/sockets-and-network-programming-in-c/)

It is not directly related to `epoll()`, but it explains really well how sockets work with examples using `select()` and `poll()`.

## I tested this server and it's cool! Now I'd like to clean it up. What do I do?

1. In your terminal, stop the server by clicking on `CTRL + C`
2. Go outside of the repository: `cd ..`
3. Remove the repository: `rm -rf 11_webserv`
